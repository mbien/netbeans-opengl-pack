                    <b>Description</b><br>
                    High Dynamic Range rendering demo utilizing 16-bit-per-channel floating-point pbuffers through NVidia, ATI or Apple extensions.
                    Uses NVidia HILO or Apple or ATI floating point cubemaps. Intermediate results are rendered to floating-point pbuffers and
                    tonemapped to 24-bit RGB before display. Original source code supplied in NVidia's SDK. 
                    <p>
                        This demo is known to work on Windows
                        with suitable NVidia or ATI hardware, and on X11 platforms with suitable NVidia hardware (no floating-point pbuffer support is
                        available on X11 from ATI as of this writing). The demo should run properly on Mac OS X soon pending some driver-level bug fixes.
